Boiler plate to get a new react project quickly up and running.

"npm run-script build"
    - Creates a development/production bundle (configurable from within webpack.config.js) of the index.js. 

"npm start"
    - Launches a local server (also configurable from within webpack.config.js and live reloading enabled). 

** Babel pre-configured, so everything will compile down for cross-browser compatibility.
** SASS loaders added for easier styling
